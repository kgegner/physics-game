Beyonce is driving to the Grammy Awards. She travels 70 km east on Hwy-1 from her hotel, to the Staples Center in Los Angeles, but upon her arrival realizes she forgot her husband, Jay-Z, at the hotel. She turns around, but stops after 15 km when she sees Taylor Swift walking along the road with 10,000 of her squad members, obviously having forgotten the Grammys were today. Taylor Swift leaves her squad to continue on their walk, and hops in the car with Beyonce. 

Where are Taylor and Beyonce relative to Jay-Z?
