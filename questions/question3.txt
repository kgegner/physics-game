As hosts of the Grammy Awards, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will make their grand entrance to the stage by sled. Amy and Tina will sled down a low friction track, from the top of two separate aisles that lead directly to the stage. But, to be sure their entrance is truly grand, there will be a shower of confetti and light show that begin exactly 10 seconds after their sleds leave the top of the aisle/track. If the top of each aisle is 35 ft above the stage and 48 ft away from it, will they need to get a running start to make it to the stage in time for the light show and confetti, or can they just start sitting statically at the top of the track?

You should assume that the track has a coefficient of friction of 0.2, and that the mass of both sledder and rider is 75 kg. 
Your drawing only needs to represent Tina Fey or Amy Poehler, not both!
