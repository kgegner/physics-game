Hi there! I am a new production assistant for the Grammy Awards and I am having trouble getting everything done for the show. On top of putting together an entire Winter Wonderland themed awards show, I also have to coordinate travel plans for a few celebrities.


I need someone who can sketch out some of my problems so my team can better understand what I need help with. Do you think you can help me? You seem like the perfect person for the job!
